Uh ye

You cant bury alive

anything that was

ready to die

You cant clip wings

made of fire

Thats gods work

The phoenix saga continues


Neeye oli

nee thaan vali

Oyathini odambe

Neeye thadai neeye vidai

Soodaak kiddu narambe


Six feet deep where

They left us for

dead and I

Dug myself out the mud

With my knuckles

Learned to float

like a butterfly

Sting like a

killer bee

Kill or be fuel

for them fools

Is you kidding Shit

I would rather

be in hell

For being reckless

with my special

Bet you bet you

bet you bet you

Before I see the

pearly gates

Ill be shining

With my pearly whites

And smiling in their face

Spit the blood

up out my mouth

And move them

mountains out the way


Sottum sottum veyrva

Thinam sollum

Unakkoru theerva

Acham acham porva

Athai vittu

Illaka nee serva

Munnadi vai kaala

Parampara nimirum unnala

Muneri vai kaala

Thalamura eluthum unpera

Kadala ponguthu rosam

Vilaiyadu unokkosam

Thadai sollaa thaippasum

Nee jaikkanum athukkosum

Kadala ponguthu rosum

Vilaiyadu unokkosum

Thadai sollaa thaippasum

Nee jaikkanum athukkosum


Neeye oli nee thaan vali

Oyathini odambe

Neeye thadai neeye vidai

Soodaakkiddu narambe


Ten toes down

we in this bitch

Ten rounds up

against the ropes

Act like king

of jungle and

End up as some

antelopes

Who gonna pray for

You when you meet

Your maker at the

end of that barrel

Who gonna sing

for you

When you sing

that swan song

With no encore

Back when

I was blooming

Couldn not buy

my mamma shit

Had to tell

her hold on

I got made in

jaffna in the clip

Had no food up

in the house

I couldnt buy

my daughter lunch

Now Im bout to

take my mamma house

shopping after brunch

A bunch of mother fuckin

Undercover swine

Thats trying to slide

Inside this culture

That we fought for

Flipped and built

into empires

Made some millis

with no middlemen

We did this independent

I was gonna

kill a couple

But they wouldnt

let me finish

Like stop he is

dead already‚Äù

Svdps off his

meds already

Gotta take that up with

The head committee

I dont run this joint

Im just settling

A hand of god

a messenger

A prophet or a

servant

For the people

Ive been sleeping

On the edge of sanity

And leaping into

my glory

All glory to god


Yeru yeru yeru

Yeru yeru yeru

nee mela

Inga yaaru yaaru yaaru

Yaarumilla un pola


Urukkulaintha udamba usupu

Irulladaintha ellumba ellupu

Inikuninja idathil

Nimirnthu sanatha thirattu


Onankku neethaan ella

Thonaikku yaarum illa


Adida adima unara

Idida imayum thinara

Adida adima unara

Idida imayum thinara

Adida adima unara

Idida imayum thinara


Back on my glorious

shit again

This is the making

of legends

Who making a killing

We make it look easy

I know this is the issue

Cause now you

got dummies

Who testing me

Knowing that this

is a pedigree

Only made only

When making a goat

Tell me again

Who you think

is a threat

And I bet I can

show you

The butt of a joke

Show me a rapper

I could not behead

And I will show you

A body thats

standing alone

Used to look up to

My idols on my tv

Now I look up to

My idols on

my mantle

When I told you

I was greatest

brown rapper

I was lying

I meant any mammal

I meant any pigment

I meant any everybody

Eeny meeny miny

anybody get it

Pick out any

mother fucker

Any generation

any city

Any kind of tier

A feather welter

heavy weight

Or anybody in the

weighting room

Thats waiting by

Stick a fork in

every category this

Been over way before

it started out

Now they went and

woke a sleeping

giant up from slumber

Look what you

done started now


Neeye oli nee thaan vali

Oyathini odambe
